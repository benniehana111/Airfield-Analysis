# Airfield-Analysis

## Topic

This project will automate collection of data on airfields in the Pacific Ocean, build an airfield database, and employ unsupervised machine learning models to create a classification schema for the airfields based on their size, runway surface, facilities, and usage. 

## Rationale

I consult with aerospace companies, investors, and other interested parties who need to understand business opportunities for new types of aircraft in various Pacific Ocean regions.

## Data Description

The data required for this study comes from two principal sources: (1) Google Earth, and (2) Wikipedia.  Google Earth allows us to search selected geographic regions to identify all the airfields located therein and to compile a list of airfield names and/or alphanumeric codes that identify each airfield.  Wikipedia provides consistently formatted data on airfields, including names, airport codes, airport types, operatorss, latitude/longitudes, runway length(s), runway surface(s), and runway heading(s).  It also provides text narratives with additional information on airfield geography, history, and operations.

## Objectives

Compiling this data will create a useful reference dataset that can be accessed and browsed in Google Earth. Automating this process will save large amounts of work required for manual data collection and analysis. The ML model will generate a classification schema for use in detailed transportation studies that inform decisions involving, aircraft basing, aircraft routing, and investments in upgrading existing airfields and/or developing new facilities.
